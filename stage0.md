The TP53 gene is a tumor suppressor gene that is mutated in approximately 50% of human cancers \[1]. The TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, which acts as a transcriptional factor by binding DNA elements in the nucleus called p53 response elements (p53REs) on the promoters of target genes to control the expression of downstream genes \[2].

**TP53 in cancer**

TP53 is renowned as the “guardian of the genome” because of the crucial role that the p53 protein plays in regulating cell division and preventing mutations \[1].

Physiologically, p53 is continuously produced and degraded by a delicate system that involves post-translational modifications and an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase (MDM2) \[3]. In the absence of stress signals (oncogene activation, DNA damage, replicative stress), this system continuously degrades p53 protein. In presence of these stress signals, the degradation of the protein stops stabilizing its levels so that it can activate various processes to “save” the cell such as cell cycle arrest, senescence, DNA repair and apoptosis \[3].

Since p53 is a master regulator of these important processes to ensure cell survival and repair, mutations in TP53 (or other genes that are involved in the network that stabilizes the p53 protein) will lead to an uncontrolled proliferation of cells with damaged DNA that will tend to accumulate more mutations, leading to the formation of cancer cells \[4].


### **The role of TP53 as a biomarker in cancer**

A biomarker is a characteristic that is measured as an indicator of normal biological or pathological processes \[6]. Since specific mutations in TP53 characterize cancer cells, we can use these signatures to predict prognosis, response to therapy, and overall survival of patients \[4].


### **The importance of biomarker discovery**

Biomarkers are important from a prognostic point of view, as understanding the presence of a certain genetic or transcriptional signature in a cancer patient helps in understanding the prognosis for that patient \[7].

Additionally, biomarker discovery is useful in personalized medicine, particularly in cancer research \[8]. Cancer is a broad term that indicates a vast number and variety of different types of tumors. Moreover, every type of tumor is extremely heterogeneous from patient to patient \[7].

Identifying biomarkers helps characterize subgroups based on specific biomarkers. This will help to understand whether this subset of specific patients will respond to certain targeted therapies or not \[7].


### **How to discover new biomarkers**

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are fundamental for biomarker discovery. DNAseq, RNAseq, and proteomics techniques help in identifying mutations and gene expression profiles at the transcript and protein levels that characterize cancer patients \[8]. Rapid advancements in these types of technologies are crucial as they enable the detection of different types of mutations \[8].

In addition, because a large amount of data is produced in a short period of time, it is important to have computational power to process and analyze the data, and researchers that can draw biological and reliable conclusions \[8].


### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene that is highly involved in cancer owing to its fundamental role in cellular functions. Mutations in TP53 found in human cancers represent a hallmark in this field, showing its potential as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in the context of personalized medicine.

Furthermore, the ongoing advancements in genomic technologies and data analysis to detect new changes in the genome, transcriptome, and proteome are crucial for the discovery of new biomarkers and classify them as prognostic or predictive to help in making more precise prognoses and developing new targeted therapies for specific subsets of patients.
